    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here I will teach out how to make Cookie and Kate's famous falafel recipe!</p>

    <p>It tastes great in the air fryer. What a world we live in that appliances such as air fryers exist, right?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup dried chickpeas</li>
        <li>1/2 cup roughly chopped red onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly GBP</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps/How to make</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>With an oven rack in the middle position, preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour ¼ cup of the olive oil into a large, rimmed baking sheet and turn until the pan is evenly coated.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, combine the soaked and drained chickpeas, onion, parsley, cilantro, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, cinnamon, and the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Process until smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, scoop out about 2 tablespoons of the mixture at a time. Shape the falafel into small patties, about 2 inches wide and ½ inch thick. Place each falafel on your oiled pan.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, carefully flipping the falafels halfway through baking, until the falafels are deeply golden on both sides. These falafels keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for several months.</li>
    </ol>
